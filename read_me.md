# READ_ME
---
* I have created this readme file to say that I have completed the extra credit course for this assignment.

### What I Like about this course:
* I'm a novice when it comes to writing code in R, but I am very much interested and keen to write code and apply data mining techniques in R.
* what I expect from this course is that, I want to perform some data visualization with R and data mining techniques.
* I want to apply this experience in R hands-on to real world projects.
