## Git:
1. Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS), which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing.
2. Git can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you’ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be
3. Git also makes working with others easier—groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source.

## Github Workflow:
1. Create Repository
2. clone the repository
3. Commiting and pushing the file from local machine to the remote repository in the Github.

## Still confused about:
1. Pulling request.
2. Need more pratice in creating the repository.
3. Creating an .md file
