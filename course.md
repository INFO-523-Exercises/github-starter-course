## What I've Learned:

1. **Basics of Data Mining Techniques**: The core concepts and techniques, such as clustering, classification, and regression.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The importance of cleaning and transforming data, ensuring it's ready for effective mining.

## ðŸ¤” What I'm Still Wrapping My Head Around:

1. *Math part of the models*: While I get the basics, the deep underlying mathematics can sometimes be overwhelming.
2. **Language R**: Learning a completely new language for coding is always extremely challenging, but i am getting used to it!
3. **Github**: I have used Github for the first time in my life for so long, and I am currently familiarizing myself with the basics.
